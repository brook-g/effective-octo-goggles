subtitle: possibly the beginning of something new

What started as a thought experiment is becoming an [experiment in artistic style](https://x.com/mrbrookg/status/1788129143944573342?s=46). [This](https://x.com/mrbrookg/status/1774293119246221422?s=46) experiment is morphing into interesting pieces.

Now is a good time to pause and explore why *typing instructions* is important.

[*typing instruction*](https://x.com/mrbrookg/status/1789167932007735395?s=46)’s importance will expand as I dive deeper into it and find ways to integrate its philosophy, or artistic style into my practice. 

As of this writing, here are two reasons that make *typing instructions* important.

1. It paves way for experiments in artistic style that use tools of creation as central piece(s) of the work. At the center of *typing instructions* is a recognizable figure — the keyboard.
2. It is a different route for my work. Whether or not I want to take that route — and whether it’ll be a one way or roundtrip journey — is completely up to me. 

After [Glimpses of Existence](https://opensea.io/collection/glimpses-of-existence), I’ve been searching for a clear philosophical foundation for my practice that has deeper roots in the overarching vision for my work. *typing instructions* seems like a good start.
