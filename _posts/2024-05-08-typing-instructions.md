Like the pen, the keyboard has become a uniquely powerful tool is [building worlds](https://twitter.com/0x113d), [playing games](https://twitter.com/cryptothegame_), [exposing secrets](https://twitter.com/Snowden), [investigative work](https://twitter.com/zachxbt), and more. It served as a unique interface between the mind and the digital world.

[June 1, 2007](https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/evolution-of-the-mobile-phone-keyboard) kicked off a teleportation of a physical interface into the digital realm. The touchscreen removed the need for physicality in portable digital devices. What started off as a trend soon became a ubiquity. It went digital, and has come to serve more than one function, while taking up less space. Digital keyboards made it easy to switch between languages, use symbols, and emojis – all in one device. Convenience at its best.

Ubiquity brings with it a kind of forgetfulness. The item becomes useful — and consequently important — its significance becomes less about who or what made it, and more about its necessity.

Necessities, when available 24/7, are taken for granted.

By using the keyboard as a central piece in an experimental artistic style, [*typing instructions*](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x50205070c350d0c382565635cb4b252c06ed1416/6), spotlights the most overlooked interface.

Changing its role from a tool used to create (a paint brush of sorts), to a piece *within* the creation. Questioning the disappearance of ubiquitous items in the things they helped create.
