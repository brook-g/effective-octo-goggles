Dearest,

In your pursuit of building a life, you’ve forgotten to truly live. Deadlines preoccupy your thoughts, while the inevitability of death remains overlooked.

You’re confined by time, neglecting the Timeless One. You ignore eternity, focusing solely on the now—a fleeting, graspable, transient now.

With my head buried in work, designing and creating for money, I missed the essence of life. I, too, was consumed by the infinite now's, neglecting the infinite.

When death took people with whom I didn’t spend enough time, regret took hold. I was a walking flesh, oblivious to world around me. The infinite now’s became empty promises.

Awareness of death’s inevitability slows you down, allowing you to savor the present. This unsettling realization ignites a search for the permanent where infinity exists.

Death grants us a fresh perspective, a rebirth of sorts. Understanding our finite existence gifts us with a renewed appreciation for life.

So, beloved, when you focus on earning the next buck or meeting the next deadline, breathe slowly. Pace down, look around you. Look at the world in a new light. And see how it responds to you. Spend more time appreciating those around you, embrace yourself, appreciate your existence not because you are unique, but because you are now alive.
