subtitle: a luxury you're unaware of
---
You have been endowed with a luxury that’s taken for granted. 

Choice.

The ability to become aware of alternatives in using resources for a specific activity, and pick one that brings the most upside, at different time horizons.

Think about it. You and I can choose what to think, just as much as you choose what to do per unit of time. For instance, I chose to write this just as much as you have *chosen* to read it. You made the choice to read it over a screen rather than printing it. I made the choice to write using specific words structured in a specific way. I chose to let the cursor blink five times before writing this sentence...

Okay, I’ll stop nerding out.

But know this.

You are endowed with a luxury of choice, but it requisites awareness. How can you become aware of this luxury?

Recognize that there are choices outside of what you are presented with. Like when [Tyrion Lannister asked for Trial by Combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCcDm2fGKXI).

Tyrion was to plead either guilty or not guilty for the charges that were brought against him. He was aware of a *third* choice - [Trial by Combat](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_by_combat). Judging from the crowd and Tywin’s reaction, this was unexpected. ([Law 17](https://mubashirali6864.medium.com/the-17th-law-of-power-be-unpredictable-64a199b66c6e)).

Tyrion knew the ins and outs of the law. He knew he can’t beat the system because everyone was against him. Trial by Combat was his way out. Here’s why:
1. [The law](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_by_combat) allows Trial by Combat for highborns. Being a Lannister, Tyrion knew he could use it.
2. “[I’ll let the gods decide my fate](https://youtu.be/TCcDm2fGKXI?t=148)” removes the need for human intervention. The king *and* judge, Tywin Lannister, is left powerless.

Tyrion used the law and his privilege as a highborn to disarm the king and keep himself alive.

Think of time as a platform for choice.

Each moment is unique and irretrievable. Each moment registers a choice. Time determines the number of unique and irretrievable moments dedicated to an activity. Answers to “What do I want to do/be in x unit of time?” are exclusive by nature. 

Naturally, you want to decrease the [Opportunity Cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp)s of choice(s) made. You want higher upside, with disproportionately downsized resource allocation. You want to spend less time mastering a skill. You want to spend less money acquiring high value assets. This is where intention steps in. Preceded by slowing down.

Practice making less hasty decisions. Practice connecting your higher vision with your daily life. Practice making each moment contribute to your higher vision. [*Pray without ceasing*](https://discoveringprayer.com/blog/7-ways-to-learn-to-pray-without-ceasing) (1 Thessalonians 5:16-18), is a kind reminder. 

When you slow down, you cultivate clarity. You become aware of choices, revealed and unrevealed. You know what to choose. You know why. 

No, you don’t need to stick to a choice you make. You can change your mind anytime, anywhere. Unless it affects others, avoid the need to explain your choice(s).

You don’t need to justify your choices. You don’t need a rational, logical explanation for what you choose to do, or think. But realize that, making up your mind initiates self-accountability. A consequence of which is growth.

Choice is an egalitarian luxury. Lacking this awareness makes choice an exclusive luxury. When you take it for granted, leads to an unexamined life. Choice requisites awareness. Knowing it exists [can save your life](https://youtu.be/TCcDm2fGKXI?t=148). 

Time is a platform for making choices. Deciding what we want to do/be in x unit of time initiates a level of self-accountability that leads to consistency. Consistently matching your highest vision with choices in shorter time horizons from the present brings growth.
