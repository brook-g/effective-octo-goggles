There’s a gift hidden in progress. A gift that defies this race against time we find ourselves trapped in. Momentum is a [gift given to those making progress](https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm).

Momentum is understanding that we are the ones responsible for our progress. We control the difficulty and efficiency of our progress.

Need to finish writing 30,000 words in 3 months? Write 10,000 words a month. Or 30,000 words in a month. Or 20,000 in a month, then finish the rest slowly before the deadline.

Need to raise 1M? Self-fund it now. Or raise batches of it at different times. Or find a rich person to do it for you.

Momentum can go to zero. But that isn’t desirable. The point is to have a baseline number. Non-zero, Positive Momentum.

Either work on difficult tasks at slower speeds, or easier tasks at faster speeds. Whatever the approach, maintain a Non-zero, Positive Momentum.

The gift of making progress of any kind is realizing that one must keep moving forward. By varying levels of difficulty and efficiency of undertakings, maintain non-zero, positive momentum.
