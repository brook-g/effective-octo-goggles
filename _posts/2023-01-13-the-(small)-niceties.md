as an [INFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality), [Si (introverted sensing)](https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/infj-darkness-understanding-infjs-shadow-functions/)  is my weakest cognitive function. that means i tend to forget -- and at times, forgo -- the day-to-day: sleep, food, etc.

i've come to recognize these necessities as niceties:

- _sunlight_. i wake up and let the sun hit my eyes. something nice about that. i leave my phone in another room the night before, sleep, wake up and let the sun hit my eyes like [Andrew Huberman said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDv4AWk0J3U&t=292s).
- _naps_. whether it is after eating well, or when i am trying to catch up on sleep, the after-feeling of naps feels nice.
- _inaction_. there is a subtle magic in doing nothing. i take a pause from my-to-day, breathe, and try to be. some times it lasts for seconds, sometimes minutes.
- _sitting on the floor_. very nice.
- _walks_. nice slow walks. i go out at 17:30 for an hour long walk around my neighborhood. leaving all of my day-to-day related thoughts at home.
- _water_. a glass of mildly cold water that is at the right temperature. one that leaves a nice 'weight' on my tongue. i pour water into a jug, put some ice. and wait for it to melt. the disproportion of ice-to-water modifies the water's temperature to _exact_ kind of water i like.

more niceties i'd rather keep to myself. it feels _nice_ to have secrets, dark or light.
