You choose your growth. You control the difficulty and efficiency of the progress you make. Whether it’s deciding to write a book in 3 months or write a short story in minutes, you decide the weight, the intensity and consistency of your work.

It took me WEEKS to change [this writing](https://1092.co/note%20to%20self/value-momentum/) from a draft to this 121-word post. In that time, I chose to work on other long forms, at different times, in different energies. I didn’t stop writing. I wrote differently, about different things, at different times.

The task is to find ways to begin progress, and maintain it. Through doing difficult things slow, or easy things fast, strive to maintain progress.

Then you discover momentum, a gift of progress.
