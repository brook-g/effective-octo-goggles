subtitle: a path to (l)earn confidence is knowing that is earned, but first learned.
category: Note to Self

Confidence is a deep conviction in yourself and your abilities. A conviction built on evidence. To some, evidence is provided. Kickstarting their path towards (l)earning confidence.

After [Jon Snow learned that he’s Aegon Targaryen](https://youtu.be/IwW0kFpYYq0?t=100), he became a hesitant leader who later decided to prioritize the Greater Good - fighting the White Walkers.

To others, evidence is built. One must learn how to build. Building evidence is not as straightforward as one might think. 

Arya Stark’s evidences were built when she looked back, remained present, and built her future. Looking back, we learn how Arya is unfit for a traditional lady-like role that was expected of her. Fueled by her father’s execution, she became an assassin. Through it all, she [remained a stark of Winterfell](https://youtu.be/kF9VLphyTtE?t=292). Her search for revenge was confident. She confirmed her abilities, and found her identity.

I’ve been given a chance to (l)earn confidence. A chance at re-discovering my identity as God’s creation, a human being, friend, provider, procreator, analyst, writer, skeptic, designer, builder, worshipper, wrongdoer, thinker, believer, builder, destroyer, liar, artist. I’ve been given a chance at confirming my abilities. Abilities to create, destroy, maintain, neglect, teach, forget.

Where’s the evidence?

While updating this website, I added ‘about’ and ‘now’. These will remain constant reminders of what I’ve done and what I’m doing. 

But ‘about’ and ‘now’ don’t show what I *am*. Being precedes doing. Action spring from the being, not the other way around. While there are multiple ways to experience a being, time is what I want to focus on. The mention of time and experience imply an increase length, but the discussion here disregards that. Length of time does not correspond to how Being is experienced.

Being is better discovered. Dedicating *quality* time to experience Being rewards us with discoveries. Shared discoveries are stories that others relate to at different levels. These stories can leave the reader feeling elevated or diminished. Reactions, I hope, hints to the reader’s Being.

But remain optimistic, beloved. For [Ye shall know them by their fruits](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A16-20&version=KJV). Being is discovered through Him then strengthened by repeated action.

‘About’ and ‘Now’ are a somewhat narrow glimpse of Being. Evidences that will help me (l)earn more confidence.

To develop a deep sense of conviction in self and abilities will require evidence. Evidence is provided and/or built. Building is preceded by discovery of Being. Shared discoveries are fruits of Being.

— Written by a twisted, tired, [Introverted Thinking function](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-traits-of-INFJs-who-have-high-Ti) who’s severely overthought the addition of ‘About’ and ‘Now’.
