I heard someone use fear as an acronym. “False evidence appearing as real” they said. For some reason it stuck with me and I was reminded of it as I sat down to write.

Is this how we grapple with the unknown? Creating acronyms that expand on what the word means?

I do the same, but instead of making up acronyms, I will define fear based on my experience and understanding.

We don’t know fear. We experience its symptoms and effects. Defining it is a vain pursuit. We can, however, begin to understand what it is when we closely observe its symptoms, effects and how we make decisions based on that.

Fear is a form of self-preservation. It is a deeply rooted evolutionary adaptation that has helped all of our ancestors avoid or confront danger. In evolutionary psychology, fear helped our ancestors survive and pass on their genes. In a way, you are here because of a temporal combination of fight-or-flight responses.

In the modern world, fear keeps us from experiencing higher forms of ourselves, our environment, and others. You want to put in consistent work, but you can’t. You want to achieve better things, but you won’t. The minute you think about what’s better for you, fear in all its mouths pukes words of discouragement.

> The fear of man brings a snare [...]
> — Proverbs 29:25

Considering the recency of the Book of Proverbs (written in 10th BCE), we see fear evolve from self-preservation to a snare brought by the fear of the temporary opinions or (in)actions of fallible human beings.

The fear of man, the environment, and that which is external and is easier to manage than those that come from within.

What about the fear of failure and, surprisingly, the fear of success? 

I experience both. Sometimes as compulsion and procrastination. Other times as subtle reminders or splinters of mindsets from an old life that tell me that I am just not good enough. 

Fear of failure diminishes chances of starting with what we have. Fear of failure makes procrastination second nature because I’d rather let time pass than create opportunities for witnessing my own failure.

These fears are attached to unrealistic expectations and an (overly) ambitious understanding of our capacity as human beings. The less aware we are of them, the more they dictate our life.

> Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.
> — Carl Jung

Fear is a friend that no longer serves your higher purpose. And you don’t fight your old friend, you simply bid farewell. The first step is knowing that you’re afraid to run. Then, you put one foot in front of another despite the noises in your head, the compulsion to stop or procrastinate.

Run.
