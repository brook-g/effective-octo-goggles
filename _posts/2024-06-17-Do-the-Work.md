You are a multifaceted being. You have multiple interests and underestimate your own limitations. You believe in your ability to do a million things at once and save the world but in reality, you can only focus on a limited set of things spread over time.

I am learned this later in life. At first, I assumed this meant mutilating my interests in pursuit of one. So I stopped writing and making art to focus on UX Design. I was unhappy. I later learned to find work that aligns all interests to accomplish a few key objectives. This is how to excel at one thing.

Perfectionism creeps in when choosing the one thing. Preparing countless spreadsheets, participating in countless workshops, asking a million questions because that one thing *has* to be impactful, enjoyable, and others would want to pay you for it. 

Ikigai, right?

Forget Ikigai. Do the work. Choose any problem, and start working. Put out a version of the solution. Then iterate violently. As frequently as possible. Only way you can learn about what you want to do is by refining a solution to a problem.

This process diminishes the ego and helps you identify your true calling.
