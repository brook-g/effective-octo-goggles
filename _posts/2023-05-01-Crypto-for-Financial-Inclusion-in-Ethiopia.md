Financial inclusion - ensuring access to financial services for everyone, particularly the underserved - is vital to economic growth and social equity. Ethiopia's National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) acknowledges this and has made strides to increase access to these essential services. However, there is still more to be done. This essay will explore how digital innovations and cryptocurrencies, when used intelligently and strategically, can break down barriers and revolutionize financial inclusion in Ethiopia.

Ethiopia's initial NFIS (2016-2020) aimed to broaden access to financial services, promote financial literacy, and encourage inclusive economic growth. Nevertheless, significant challenges remain. Therefore, the updated NFIS (2021-2025) focuses on digital financial inclusion and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, such as women and rural communities.

# Digital financial inclusion and its potential impact

Digital financial services have the power to change lives. They can reach underserved populations in remote areas with scarce traditional financial infrastructure. Mobile money platforms like Kenya's M-Pesa and Bangladesh's bKash have made remarkable progress in financial inclusion through their innovative services. Ethiopia can learn from these experiences and leverage digital technologies to empower its citizens.

# Cryptocurrencies: Unlocking financial inclusion possibilities

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum can address several barriers to financial inclusion in Ethiopia. They offer faster, cheaper, and more secure transactions than traditional financial systems without a bank account. In addition, centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance can mitigate challenges by offering a regulated, secure platform for trading cryptocurrencies.

Despite misconceptions surrounding cryptocurrencies in Ethiopia, there are some incredible examples of (other Third World) countries leveraging crypto for their betterment:

- El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender has empowered citizens by providing access to a global financial system and fostering financial inclusion.
- Zimbabwe uses cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to counter hyperinflation and promote economic stability.
- The Venezuelan "Petro" cryptocurrency was designed to combat financial exclusion and attract foreign investment.

Cryptocurrencies offer an exciting opportunity to enhance financial inclusion in Ethiopia. Yet, challenges remain:

1. Awareness: It’s human nature; unfamiliarity breeds distrust. And Cryptocurrencies are no exception. Education that brings awareness about the world of Crypto is helpful.
2. Regulation: Unclear policies create friction. Friction slows adoption which slows growth. A regulatory framework protecting consumers while promoting innovation is helpful.
3. Infrastructure: Access to basic infrastructure such electricity and internet connectivity is paramount, and we are excited to see how GERD, and the entry of foreign telecommunications companies help in providing the neccessary infrastructure.
4. Security: Cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to cyber-attacks and fraud. Centralized exchanges like Binance can provide secure on-ramp, storing, and trading platforms that mitigate these risks.
5. Volatility: The existence of stablecoins could mitigate Crypto’s volatility, which makes them challenging for everyday transactions.

# The future

Addressing these challenges will enable Ethiopia to realize the potential of cryptocurrencies to enhance financial inclusion and promote economic growth. Educating the public, developing regulatory clarity, providing infrastructure, and utilizing secure exchanges, are all essential steps in this direction.
